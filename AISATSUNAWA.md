### Finding the middle

This is a greeting and so the start should be focused on your partner
and not the rope. Finding the middle is the first action that
demonstrates this committment. By finding the middle quickly, you
avoid presenting the rope as a distraction in the greeting.

### Placing the rope

Place the rope in an extended arc over the head. Avoid disturbing the
hair. Demonstrate respect for your partner's body by maintainin some
distance to start. The motion should be gentle and non-threatening.

Creating a space by way of an arc of motion. The arc starts big and
becomes smaller, bringing the partners closer together.

Hints at an embrace.

Use fingers only. This is a gesture that lets the rope gently fall on
your partner.

### Move hair

Gently move the hair from under the rope. This is the first direct
touch and can be an important moment of connection. It's also the
first moment of your partner being an object acted upon.

Removing the hair also frees your partner from the concern of her hair
being tangled in the rope. This allows her to focus on you.

### Take the rope

Gently take the rope in your hand. This is the first point of
connection between you and your partner through the rope.

This moment is presented as a question. The answer tells you something
about your partner. Does she follow like a lamb? Does she resist? Does
she love papa? Does she hate papa?

This is a moment of observation, not judgement. If the answer is not
what you're expecting, note that. There's no coercion or
compulsion. Just acceptance.

This moment tells you something about her attitude, her sexuality, her
demeanor, her comportment.

This also lets your partner know that you're not in a hurry to start
tying and you are able to use the rope as a instrument of
communication. This is the first moment that she has to respond to the
rope tension, its movement, and your inquisitiveness.

Use this moment to encourage togetherness and fluidity, as a dance.

This is not a techincal exercise, to obtain useful information used
later on. It is exercise of observance, acceptance, and humility. The
interaction may go differently than expected or prefered and this step
establishes acceptance of that. It encourages your partner to feel
free to express herelf naturally and avoids burdening her with
expectation.

"Ther is no sword can oppose kindness."

By kind and humble.

This exercise does not explore compulsion but rather kindness. It
communicates that you mean your partner no harm. It communicates that
cooperation is good for her, for you, and for world peace!

### Left arm forward

With your right hand, place the rope between your thumb and
hand. Bring the rope to her upper arm (takate). Use your thumb to
gently caress her upper arm forward. Present a forward motion, gently
and subtly, giving her an oppotunity to sense your intention.

Eventually, maybe, the arm will come forward.

### Catch both hands

With your partner's left arm forward, having been gently guided with
your right hand, extend your left arm under her right arm and through
to under her left arm. Extend your left arm far through hers. Both of
her arms are now captured by yours.

Pass the rope from your right hand to your left, letting it sit
between your thumb, pointing up, and hand.

Her arms are locked in a V shape. Pressing down on her arms will have
the effect of raising her up on her toes. She is under leverage in
this position.

Your partner is in potential danger. Her arms are locked at the elbow
and subject to painful leverage. Give your partner a moment to
appreciate the change in dynamic. Maintain gentleness and kindness
while allowing the threat to present itself to her.

The locked arm position is also a lever to bring you and your partner
together. Let her feel your body against hers as she experiences this
initial bondage. Lean into her to provide, stability, and comfort.

### Bring rope through and catch

With your left hand, place the rope in the middle of her upper arm
(takate) and bring it through her arms. Use your right hand against
her right arm as leverage, maintaining her arms in the locked
position. This motion simultaneously pushed with your right hand and
pulls the rope with your left. Use fritction in your left hand against
the rope to maintain tension in this process.

Once the rope is through her arms, place it in the same position on
her right upper arm in the middle.

Move the rope from your left to your right.

Extend your left arm under your right toward her left shoulder. Catch
the rope between her neck and upper arm with your left index finder
from the bottom of the rope.

While maintaining tension on the rope between your hands -- your left
hand catching the rope on her neck, your right right holding the
working end (nawajiri) -- lean in close to read her brainwaves.

Pass the rope with your right hand to catch it with your left index
finder. Catch the rope slightly high on her neck. This puts the rope
in position to be drawn down and tightened later.

Bring the rope through only enough to create a friction and then stop.

### Exercise control

While maintaining the rope friction with your left hand, slide your
left forearm on top of her shoulder. This configuration establishes
control over her locked arms and shoulder, giving your considerable
lerverage over her upper body.

Use this point of control to demonstrate your control.

This is the first point of true bondage, of being captured.

Your engergy, your ki, should be directed into your partner.

### Pull rope through (upper wrap)

Maintaining tension on the rope with your right hand, gently pull the
rope through with your right. This motion can be slow and sensual in
contrast to the sensation of being controlled.

### Pull rope down (upper wrap)

In a series short motions, pull the rope straight down with your right
hand. The rope should be pulled in five to six steps rather than in a
single motion. This should be drawn out as it's the first experience
of constriction.

Use your left hand under her neck as leverage as you pull the rope
down, keeping your left forearm on her shoulder.

This is an opportunity to show your partner your attitude. Are rough
and mean or gentle and kind? This is an opportunity for her to assess
your demeanor and intention. This can be an emotional moment for both
of you.

### Wrap the forearms (kote)

Maintaining tension on rope, pass the rope from your right hand to
your left hand. With your left hand, place the rope on her forearm
below the elbow.

Bring the rope under her forearms with your left hand, passing the
rope to your right hand. Maintain tension on the rope as you bring it
up around her left forearm.

### Catch the rope (lower wrap)

Maintaining tension on the rope, pass the rope from your right hand to
your left hand. Place your right index finger as high as possible
under the lower binding from the bottom. Catch the rope with your
index finger creating a friction.

### Pull the rope down (lower wrap)

With your right hand, pull the rope down. As with the upper wrap, pull
the rope down in a series of steps rather than in one gesture.

The gradual tightening of the rope feels good. There is an
inevitability in these steps, each one increasing the sense bondage.

### Finish the rope

Once the lower wrap is tight, find a place for the remaining rope that
creates a small amount of friction. This might be through the hands.

### Take a deep breath and assess

Step away and take a deep breath. Give your partner a moment to assess
the new situation that she has been put in.

### Check rope tensions

With a single finger, check points of the tie for tension. Use your
finger to invite her to respond. This is a similar moment to the
start, when you presented your partner with a question, letting her
respond. In this case, the questions are similar -- present them to
connect and to observe her response. Avoid the temptation to use too
much force, to put her under compulsion. This is an exercise of
communication without expectation or presumption. Demonstrate that
your partner is free to do as she wills.

Use subtlety to gauge your partner's responsiveness.

### Untie

Reverse the tie, maintaining tension at each previous friction point.

Maintain a strong physical presence, using your left forearm to
communicate control and power to your partner.

### Remove rope

Using a wide arc, remove the rope from your partner's neck.

### Conclude greeting

With the rope removed, bow to your partner and thank her.

1. Rope
2. Physical connection
3. Emotional connection
4. Presentation

## Other Concepts

While tying other patterns, I find myself tapping into principles
learned inthe aisats exercise.

### Deep breath, asses, and check

This helps to slow me down. It encourages presence and attention to
detail. It connects me to my partner. It helps avoid mistakes.

### Signals of connection and dominance

The use of my forearm on her shoulder, steped puls, etc. are all
intentional signals to my partner. These al contribute to asense of
conection and of submission to a caring and attentive master.
